Spencer et al.1 find that different sets of sister cells respond differently in the time they take to die after exposure to the apoptotic stimulus TRAIL. 
Why do cells of the same population respond differently to external
death-inducing stimuli? 


Mass cytometry is a mass spectrometry technique based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry combined with mass tags that allows accurate measuring of various molecular species on single cells in a highly multiplexed fashion. In this approach, antibodies are tagged with isotopically pure rare earth elements and these are used to tag the components of cells. 

Cells are nebulized and sent into argon plasma, breaking molecular bonds and ionizing metal tags, which are then analyzed by a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The approach overcomes limitations of spectral overlap that limit flow cytometry, allowing simultaneous quantification of 50 mass tag channels.
